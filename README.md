# Command-Line Todo List App

### Description

This project is a simple yet powerful command-line Todo List application built with Python.
It allows you to manage your daily tasks directly from the terminalâ€”no web browser or GUI required!

The application is designed to help you:
- Add tasks quickly with a title and category,
- View all your current and completed tasks in a colored, organized table,
- Update or delete tasks easily,
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete,
- Store your todo list between sessions using a local database,
- And more, using intuitive commands!

All data is saved using an SQLite database, so your list never disappears, and the interface is made user-friendly and visually pleasing with the Rich and Typer Python libraries.
